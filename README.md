# Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project was started as an introduction to Vanderbilt's Coding Bootcamp. I began this project as an attempt to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As well as to understand the basics of the GitHub workflow and acquire the knowledge for building a functional and professional repository.
