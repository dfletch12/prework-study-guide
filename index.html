        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>External style sheet link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>An * applies a rule to all the elements visible</li>
          <li>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse code in order to reduce the number of lines on the page</li>
          <li>The link element creates a connection to an external file</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose</li>

          <li>The .js file extension indicates that this file is a JavaScript file</li>
          <li>To declare a variable we use the var keyword and then a unique name</li>

          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon</li>
          <li>The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
          <li>A method is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
